## Background
-Data was borrowed from a grad student by Kaleb 
- This data is formated in 
  - Illumina Hi Seq 2500
  - Paried end reads
  - 250 bp sequencing reads
  - 20 samples total
- Two collection method
  -  one where the duckweed was skimmed  from the top of the pond
  - one where there was no skimming was used sample was directly taken from the pond
- Each sample had 5 replicates of each treatment
  - A metadata file was used to tell Qiime program which samples are which
  -  A manifest file was used to tell Qiime where the fastq files are located for importing of data and tables               
## Materials and Methods
This project was done using the Qiime2 Amplicon environment through Conda.
